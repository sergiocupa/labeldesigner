# Label Designer

Project designed to create and edit label layouts for thermal printers or black and white printing.
Usually these labels are used in packaging with the function of identification or to enable tracking of the same.

Some features already implemented:
- Text editing
- Rendered text. Character with non-western spelling can be used, such as Mandarin.
- Box graphics
- 39 or 128 bar code
- Qr code
- Datamatrix
- Image
- Zoom of the editing area

The layout is saved in JSON format.
The print layer is abstracted, but currently only supports the ZPL2 format.
